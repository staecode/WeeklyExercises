# WeeklyExercises

Javascript exercises done over Weekly Class exercises, mostly data structures 

Working repository, will continue to catch various Javascript class exercises here

Javascript experience: used minimally when I taught myself web design, in last IT job used it heavily in a few projects to
                       create a Google Map API of our locations with all necessary details etc (extremely fun!)

Class description: 300 level courses at Portland State University, Discussion of Software Engineering. Weekly class
                   programming exercises are submitted for attendence. Learned these data structures in C++, working
                   them out for the first time in JavaScript (a language with no memory management - definitely a 
                   new and weird experience.) Class quiz exercises done in 40 minute burst, end of class period.
                   Testing file allows command line selection of other files in repository, for ease of working with
                   code files each week as we create a few methods of a data structure or a new, quick data structure
                   using previously created structures.
